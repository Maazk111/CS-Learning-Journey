            If you like your coffee hot
            Let me be your coffee pot
            You call the shots, babe

            I just wanna be yours
            Secrets I have held in my heart
            Are harder to hide than I thought
            Maybe I just wanna be yours
            I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours

            Wanna be yours
            Wanna be yours
            Wanna be yours

            Let me be your leccy meter
            And I'll never run out
            Let me be the portable heater
            That you'll get cold without

            I wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)
            Hold your hair in deep devotion (I'll be)
            At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
            Now I wanna be yours
